# Clawd Mochi 🦀🤖

A physical desk companion inspired by **Clawd** — the pixel-crab mascot of Claude Code by Anthropic. An ESP32-C3 drives a 1.54" color TFT display and hosts a mobile web controller — no app, no internet, no cloud required.

**Cost: ~$6–8 · Build time: ~1 hour · Skill level: Beginner**

## What it does

Clawd Mochi sits on your desk and shows animated expressions on a small color display. You control it from any phone or browser by connecting to its built-in WiFi hotspot:

- **Normal eyes** — pixel-art square eyes with wiggle and blink animations
- **Squish eyes** — `> <` happy squint with open/close animation
- **Claude Code** — displays "Claude Code" with an interactive terminal
- **Canvas** — draw anything on the display from your phone in real time

## Wiring

> ⚠️ Connect VCC to **3.3V only** — never 5V. Use GPIO 8 and 10 for SPI (hardware SPI, fast). Do not use GPIO 6/7 for SPI.

| Display pin | ESP32-C3 GPIO  | Wire color (suggested) |
| ----------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| VCC         | 3V3            | Red                    |
| GND         | GND            | Black                  |
| SDA         | GPIO 10 (MOSI) | Orange                 |
| SCL         | GPIO 8 (SCK)   | Green                  |
| RES         | GPIO 2         | Purple                 |
| DC          | GPIO 1         | Blue                   |
| CS          | GPIO 4         | White                  |

## Software setup

### Step 1 — Install Arduino IDE

Download [Arduino IDE 2.x](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and install it.

### Step 2 — Add ESP32 board support

1. Open Arduino IDE → **File → Preferences**
2. In "Additional boards manager URLs" paste:
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
   ```
3. Go to **Tools → Board → Boards Manager**, search `esp32`, install **"esp32 by Espressif Systems"**

### Step 3 — Install libraries

Go to **Tools → Library Manager** and install both:

- `Adafruit GFX Library`
- `Adafruit ST7735 and ST7789 Library`

### Step 4 — Configure board settings

Go to **Tools** and set:

| Setting         | Value                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------- |
| Board           | ESP32C3 Dev Module      |
| USB CDC On Boot | **Enabled** ← important |
| CPU Frequency   | 160 MHz                 |
| Upload Speed    | 921600                  |

### Step 5 — Upload the sketch

1. Clone or download this repo
2. Open `clawd_mochi/clawd_mochi.ino` in Arduino IDE
3. Connect the ESP32 via USB-C
4. Select the correct port under **Tools → Port**
5. Click **Upload** (→ arrow button)
6. Wait for "Hard resetting via RTS pin..." — this means success

---

## How to use it

### Connect and open the controller

1. Power the ESP32 via USB-C (any USB charger or power bank)
2. Wait ~3 seconds for the boot animation to finish
3. On your phone or computer, go to **WiFi settings**
4. Connect to the network: **`ClaWD-Mochi`** · password: **`clawd1234`**
5. Open a browser and go to **`http://192.168.4.1`**

You should see the web controller:

## Claude Code status hook

The Claude Code hook streams session, prompt, tool, and completion events to Clawd Mochi over USB serial first, then UDP as a fallback.

Install it from this repo:

```bash
scripts/install_claude_hook.sh
```

On Windows, run the same command from PowerShell:

```powershell
scripts\install_claude_hook.bat
```

The installer writes a user-wide Claude Code config at `~/.claude/settings.json`, copies `cc_hook.py` into the OS user data directory, and uses Claude Code's exec-form hook config so paths with spaces work on macOS and Windows. To remove it:

```bash
scripts/install_claude_hook.sh uninstall
```

If `uv` is installed, the installer uses it automatically and writes hook entries like `uv run --script cc_hook.py`. This lets `cc_hook.py` declare its own Python dependency on `pyserial`. You can force a runner with `--runner uv` or `--runner python`.

Hook discovery cache is stored in one JSON file:

- macOS: `~/Library/Caches/ClawdMochi/cc_hook_cache.json`
- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ClawdMochi\cc_hook_cache.json`
- Linux: `${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/clawd-mochi/cc_hook_cache.json`

Set `CLAWD_MOCHI_PORT` to force a serial port, or `CLAWD_MOCHI_CACHE_DIR` to override the cache location.

## 3D case

The electronics case (body + back) is in the `clawd_mochi` model folder:

| File                                                                                 | Description                               |

### 3D Clawd (no electronics)

If you just want a display piece, use the separate 3D Clawd model (no screen or electronics cutouts).

## Assembly tips

1. Print the case file (body + back) and test-fit the display before gluing anything
2. Thread the 8 wires through the back plate slot before soldering
3. Use double-sided tape to fix the ESP32 against the inside of the back plate
4. Secure the display with 2× M2×6mm screws through the bezel holes
5. Route the USB-C cable through the back plate slot and snap the back on

## Customisation

### Eye size and position

Edit these constants near the top of `clawd_mochi.ino`:

```cpp
#define EYE_W   30    // eye width in pixels
#define EYE_H   60    // eye height in pixels
#define EYE_GAP 120   // gap between eyes
#define EYE_OX  0     // horizontal offset
#define EYE_OY  40    // vertical offset upward
```

### Logo animation duration

```cpp
// In animLogoReveal() — how long logo holds after animation
delay(1500);       // milliseconds — change this number

// Speed of the reveal drawing stroke by stroke
delay(speedMs(8)); // lower = faster
```

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome! Here are some ideas:

- **New animations** — add new expressions, transitions, or idle behaviors
- **New views** — weather display, clock, notification badges, pixel art scenes
- **Sound** — add a small buzzer for sound effects
- **Sensors** — connect a touch sensor or button for physical interaction
- **OTA updates** — add over-the-air firmware updates
- **MQTT / Home Assistant** — connect to smart home platforms

To contribute: fork the repo, make your changes, and open a pull request. Please keep the single-file structure (`clawd_mochi.ino`) so it stays easy for beginners to flash.
